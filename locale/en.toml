Album variables\npersist across all tracks on an album. Each album's information is stored separately, and is reset when the\nalbum is refreshed. The information is cleared when an album is removed. Session variables persist across all\nalbums and tracks, and are cleared when Picard is shut down or restarted.\n\nThis plugin adds eight new scripting functions to allow management of persistent script variables.\n"
